## The occuring issues and some considered solution

### Different simulation methods conflicts

>There are several methods exists in practice for simulating the CVD, even many of them claimed to be based on the same reseach (paper). 
>There involves different functionality in different senarioes. For now, I explored the existing implementation as follows:

`1.Daltonization in python`
`2.CVSimulator in Android`
`3.Peacock in python`
`and so on`

 >The bichromatic plates synthesized based on these code are contradictory after cross simulation. Thus additional verification of one
 of the correcttest should be done later.
